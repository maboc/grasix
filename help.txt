base display
	purpose : fully show a base
	Syntax  : base display <base_id>
		<base_id> : The base which must be displayed
	Remarks : This will generate a lot of output (all nodes/allattributes of those nodes/all relations/all attributes of those relations)
		  So ... be carefull
		  
base list
	Purpose : shows information about all bases
	Syntax : base list

		<base_id> : ID of the base on which the node is created
		<node_id> : ID of the node to be displayed

node new
	Purpose : Create a new node whitin base <base_id>, and add an attribute to the node.
	Syntax : node new <base id> <key> <value>
	       <base_id> : The base to which the new nodes belongs
	       <key>     : Key of the attribute, which will be added to the new node
	       <value>   : Value of the attribute, which will be added to the new node

	 	 <target_node_id>     : The node on which the relation starts
		 <relates_to_node_id> : The node to wich he relation is directed
		 <key>                : Key of the first attribute of this relation
		 <value>              : value of the first attribute of this relation

relation delete
